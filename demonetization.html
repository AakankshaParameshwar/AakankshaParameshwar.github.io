                           <h3>Overview</h3>
                           <p>On November 8th, 2016, the government banned 500Rs and 1000Rs currency notes in India to curb corruption, black money usage and to promote 'Digital India.' The incident triggered panic throughout the country as many struggled to exchange their stack of old currency notes for the new ones in time and hence adversely affected the businesses for few months. The research focused on identifying the motivation behind the use of digital payments and understanding the extent to which shopkeepers adopted cashless transactions in their daily businesses across Bangalore and Mumbai, in India.</p>
                           <div class="item">

                           </div>
                           <h3>Process</h3>
                           <p>Since we wanted to focus on technology adoption especially after demonetization, we identified that users who make a living by daily transactions would be profoundly affected by demonetization as opposed to salaried workers. Hence, we targeted shopkeepers of low-level businesses at two of India's busiest cities, Bangalore and Mumbai. I handled the qualitative research at Bangalore which involved conducting 30 in-person interviews and surveying 100 shopkeepers across Bangalore.</p>
                           <p>First, I formulated an interview protocol with plenty of open-ended questions addressing the broad themes</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Confusion & Frustration</li>
                              <li>Trade Impact</li>
                              <li>Technology Use & Changes</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>I conducted the first couple of interviews in and around the residential area where I lived in to understand how they dealt with the news and how they adjusted to the situation. Familiarity with the shopkeepers gave me an opportunity to conduct more in-depth interviews in my residential area. Next, I targeted shopkeepers at busy markets in commercial areas like Avenue Road, S P Road, etc. where it was quite challenging to rich information from shopkeepers in a short time. </p>

                           <p>Each interview was followed by hours of interview transcription and analysis to identify broad themes. We determined the statistical significance of our findings by running the tailored survey on 100 shopkeepers at Bangalore and 100 shopkeepers at Mumbai.</p>

Getting notifications through messages is fine but what if I delete those messages by mistake? See if I pay a person using cheque and it's getting processed and my challan,  pass book are updated but after two days I get a message on my mobile regarding failure or transaction and someone deletes it. I lose all information of the cheque transaction. Can i produce it in the court?</p>

                              <p>In business we can use it, but beyond that we have to keep records and update them, we don't have man power, we cannot deal with too many people. See you're asking me paytm, you're asking me credit card debit card after that you're telling me online after that NEFT, RTGS and then you're saying cash, so 7 mode of payment against earlier it was only cheque or cash. So when you move over to 7 mode of payment we have a proper equipment or machinery or software whatever it call, to update them and when that many transactions are in bulk, you require more people. So we have to at least sacrifice one or two customers and decide not to accept like paytm we don't accept, paytm is again a transaction and now if he is transferring me 800rs by paytm and bill is 2000rs balance by cheque again i've to keep separate accounts update them, that so and so has paid me so much by cash, so and so has paid me so much by paytm and same is the case with debit card or credit card, if you're paying me 1000rs by cash and 1000rs by debit card, so I've to collect debit card service tax, debit card bank charges for 1000rs and 1000rs I've to maintain separate account, that means each transaction takes more than 20 minutes of my time.</p>

                           <ul>
                              <li>Always introduce your topic of research clearly at the beginning of the interview</li>
                              <li>Patience is crucial in field research especially when plenty of users turn down the oppurtunity for an interview or survey</li>
                              <li>Don't strictly follow the interview protocol, tweak it when necessary during the conversation. Use bits of it and focus more on what the user has to say</li>
                              <li>Always make the user feel comfortable and change the line of questioning when they show such a behavior</li>
                              <li>Golden rule: Silence in an interview is not bad at all. Use it to your advantage!</li>
                           </ul>
